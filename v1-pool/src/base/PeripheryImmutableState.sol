// The abstract keyword is used to declare an abstract contract in Solidity. An abstract contract is a contract that has at least one function without its implementation or in the case when you donâ€™t provide arguments for all of the base contract constructors1. An abstract contract cannot be deployed by itself, it must be inherited by another contract that implements all the functions of the abstract contract2. The abstract keyword helps to define the structure and interface of a contract, and allows the child contract to reuse and override its functions. For example:

// // This is an abstract contract
// abstract contract Animal {
//     // This is an abstract function (no implementation body)
//     function makeSound() public virtual returns (string memory);
// }

// // This is a concrete contract that inherits from Animal
// contract Dog is Animal {
//     // This is an implemented function that overrides the abstract function
//     function makeSound() public override returns (string memory) {
//         return "Woof";
//     }
// }
